# The $500 Snowball Bet

One night after a particulary raucous evening of drinks and pool at Old Chicago my buddies and I spilled out onto the street. To our surprise, it had snowed a couple of inches while we were inside and we had been too engrossed in our evening to notice. While Bigs was struggling to remember where he'd parked his car hours earlier the rest of us argued over the merits of calling a cab. Penny didn't seem to have a preference. A buzzed Bigs or cab made no difference to him.  So while we argued Penny started tossing snowballs at a No Parking sign across the street. 

Eventually Wah reminded us that he had also driven his own car to meet us downtown, and as it so happened his car was parked the closest, and as was typical for Wah, he had also barely had anything to drink. That settled it. Wah would drive us home. 

"C'mon Penny", I said. "Wah is going to drive us back to BT's house". 

"One second" replied Penny. "I think I can hit that sign" he said, gesturing drunkenly across the street toward the No Parking sign he'd been pitching snowballs at. 

"You're too drunk to hit that sign!" I said. But he ignored me and threw another snowball. Not even close. "I can hit it" he said. "No way." I said. "There's no way you can hit that sign. It's over 100 feet away across 4 lanes of traffic. And you're drunk!". "Wanna bet?" he said cockily. 

"Sure, I'll bet you $500 dollars you can't hit that sign." I said. The chatter among the other drunkards silenced. Penny tossed another snowball, but hadn't accepted the bet. Time to sweeten the deal I thought. "And I'll give you three chances!". Still no acknowledgement from Penny as he threw another snowball. Damn, he's not biting, I thought to myself. What's it going to take to get him moving? It's cold out here! "And ... " I said with a dramatic pause while he loosed another snowball "if you lose you don't owe me anything". 

Now everyone was staring at me. "What?!" Bigs choked. But I had gotten Penny's attention and his head finally turned. His disposition completely changed. A look of focus washed over his face as his perpetual smile vanished. "I'll take that bet!" he said in a suddenly sober tone. "Hell, we should all take that bet!" laughed Bigs. "That's not a bet. It's not a bet when the loser doesn't owe you anything. It's a gift!". 

That hand't occurred to me and it took a moment for my foggy druken brain to process what Bigs had said. "Oh shit" I thought as Penny scooped up another handful of snow. His next toss was wide right by several feet. I chuckled nervously. Bigs had his hands stuffed deeply into his long wool trenchcoat and was bouncing up and down slightly. Perhaps to keep warm. Perhaps in excited anticpation of Penny's next throw. Was Bigs hoping Penny would pull it off and prove me to be a collosally bad bettor? 

"See, you can't hit it" I jeered. Hoping to rattle him. But Penny ignored me and scooped up another handful of snow. Wide left, but much closer to the sign. He was zeroing in on his target. 

Everyone was silent as Penny picked up his final handful of snow and slowly, methodically compacted it in has bare, frozen hands. He tossed it up a couple of times, as if to judge it's weight and flight characteristics. Then he cleared a spot in the snow so his feet for better purchase. For all the world he looked like a pitcher reading a catchers signals from the mound. When he was finally satisfied with his mental calculations, he took a deep breath I could see his tension release. He turned to look at me over his shoulder with a sly smirk, and then started his throw without looking. 

The snoball was in flight. It seemed to take forever to cross those four empty lanes. Time seemed to slow. I looked on dumbfounded as the snowball struck the sign. And it didn't just clip the edge of the sign. The snowball hit so dead-center that nearly all snow radiated outward from the impact in a 360 degree circle. All that was left of the snowball was a tiny bulge of snow stuck to the center of the metal sign, which now read "No Pa--ing" with the r and k covered.

The silence was abrupbtly pierced by the sound of Bigs choking to death on his own laugter. He had fallen off the sidewalk and was wallowing in the snow covered gutter. He was laughing so hard he couldn't get his footing to stand back up. Wah was laughing too, but as was his nature, was much more reserved. His was more of a polite, disbeliveing chortle. Coach patted me on the back as if to say "it's ok, you're very stupid, but we still love you" while Penny did hot laps across the street and back dodging a random late-night driver. Over to inspect the sign, do a happy dance with "Number One" fingers on both hands up in the air. Then back across the street to me to shout "Yea fucker!" and then back to the sign for another more obsene happy dance. Then back to us again giggling like a schoolgirl. 

Eventually Bigs caught his breath and stammered "what kind of an idiot bets a golfer ... a person who thrives on games of precision ... to a bet like that? He'd already thrown a half-dozen snowballs before the bet but for some reason you decide to gave him three more chances? And you tell him he won't owe you anything if he misses? Are you crazy?". 

Everyone fell silent. Nobody quite knew what would happen next. Least of which, me. Penny didn't say anything. He gathered himself and said "C'mon, let's go home" and started walking toward Wah's car. He obviously wasn't going to hold me to my bet. "Take me to the ATM" I said. 

Everyone looked at me. "You can't be serious" Bigs said. "A bet is a bet" I said. "Even a stupid bet." Penny didn't say a word. 

We all piled into Wah's Volvo and he drove me to the Wells Fargo. Unfortunately I didn't realize I had a $200 limit on my debit card. 

I returned to the car and said "Take me to a BofA ATM. I need to see if I can get cash out on my credit card". Bigs gave me a funny look. "You're worried about paying a fee when you've just lost $500?" Bigs asked incredously. 

In the end it took 3 ATMs to get all 25 $20's required to make good on my bet. Everyone was silent when I retured from the ATM at the third bank. I motioned for Penny to roll down his window as I counted twenty-five twenty dollar bills into his hand. Nobody spoke for the rest of the ride home. But in the light of the passing streetlamps I could see Penny counting and re-counting his money.  

A few weeks later Bigs called me to tell me that Penny had given him an XBox for Christmas, and he'd purchased very nice gifts for Wah and Coach as well. "Which means *you* bought me this XBox" Bigs said, teasingly. "By losing that stupid $500 bet". 

I never got a gift that year, or any other year from Penny. But one thing my friends know about me is that I'll always pay my debts.

# Penny
I met Penny through Bigs. They had been roommates for a while in college. When Bigs first introduced me to Penny I though I'd misheard him. A guy ... named Penny? What's that all about? But I didn't have a chance to ask about the nickname that night, or ever apparently. Because it was a few years later before I learned what Penny's real name was. Somehow I had just assumed it was a boy named Sue situation and never asked questions. As it turned out, Penny liked to wear penny loafers, which in turn led to Bigs giving him the nickname, which stuck. Penny never seemed to mind. He was far from insecure in his masculinity. And for good reason. Despite being on the shorter side, he seemed to have no trouble with the ladies. In fact, his long-time girlfriend of several years was a perfect 10. She was beautiful, fit, intelligent, and could flip shit back at the four of us like we were her 4 older brothers. I miss Penny's girlfriend. Those were some good ~~tits~~ times!
